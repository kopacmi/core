Change: Move user creation to a separate service

The user creation logic is moved to a separate service.
Instead of using user managers createUser directly, developers
can now use methods from CreateUserService.
Another idea behind this change is to make UI and CLI behave
same way when user is created. This change would help users
to be created using the email address. The provisioning api
is also updated to behave the same way.
